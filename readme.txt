Every Major company using Abandoned Cart modules with magento. But these modules only work if magento store email address in quote.
this is very normal in Magento quotes table we can see thousand of quotes but without email address. because magento only store email address when user move to payment step from billing step.
so to overwrite this problem i built this module which help magento to store everyoneâ€™s right way once user enter email address.
How this work :
first user need to add to cart module once user is on checkout. user fill his firstname , lastname once user enter his email address
or module capture firstname , lastname & email address and store in quotes even user left after filling email address.
then we can use Abandoned Cart modules to follow up customer.
this module works perfect with Magento EE & Magento Community Edition.
i am support every user downloading this module so support is 100% please send me emails at : sandeep@sandeepsingh.us
